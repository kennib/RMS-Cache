RMS-Cache
=========

This project scrapes and caches **predicted** travel times on Sydney's M2 motorway, then serves the most recent three hours as CSV. It uses Roads and Maritime Services data posted at http://livetraffic.rta.nsw.gov.au/traffic/travel_time/m2.json.

Results can be seen at www.internets.computer/rms_times/ (smashed into charted.co graphs).

Pull requests happily entertained as the initial commits are about as far as I can easily get on my current skill level. Front-end contributions welcomed too.

Eventual goal is to release this data as a training set for machine learning if appropriate.
